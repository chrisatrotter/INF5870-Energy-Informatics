\section{Question 1}
	As the question can conclude into multiple examples leading to the same optimal minimum, we have decided to give a time frame for when these shiftable appliances can run. Since all of the mentioned appliances for the home are shiftable, the mention of a setup time and deadline would be irrelevant. It would be sufficient to give an edge case coverage.
