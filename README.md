# INF5870-Energy-Informatics

#Course content
Energy informatics exploits the state-of-the-art ICT (information and communication technology) to tackle the global warming and
climate change challenges. The scope of energy informatics includes computing and communications technologies and their applications
for sustainable energy sectors - e.g., smart grid, solar, electric vehicles, and storage. This course lay the foundations to
understand where and how computer engineering techniques apply in the energy systems.

#Learning outcome
After this course you have:

 - knowledge about different energy systems - e.g., smart grid, electric vehicles, vehicle-to-grid, storage, transport, buildings
 - knowledge about renewable energy resources - e.g., solar and wind, and their impacts on energy systems
 - an understanding for smart grid concepts & components, including smart meters, advanced metering infrastructure, information networks,
demand response, and pricing schemes
 - an understanding of where and how computer science techniques - e.g., cloud computing, fog computing, 5G, software defined networking, big
data, game theory, optimization, apply for future sustainable energy systems
 - learned how to model power systems with software tools and real data sets to assess impact of smart grid concepts, integration of renewable resources,
storage and electric vehicles
 - met invited speakers from industry and understand the good connection between principles and their applications in real systems
